# 🚀 Just Built: Autonomous Multi-Agent Testing Framework with CrewAI!

I'm excited to share my latest project: a fully autonomous **Multi-Agent Testing System** powered by **CrewAI** and **Selenium**.

## 🤖 What it does
This system uses a team of **9 AI Agents** to handle the entire testing lifecycle for any web application:
1.  **Requirement Analysis**: Reads the webpage and understands the form fields.
2.  **Test Generation**: Creates comprehensive test cases (Positive, Negative, Boundary).
3.  **Code Generation**: Writes self-healing Selenium automation scripts (Page Object Model).
4.  **Execution & Reporting**: Runs the tests, captures logs, and **automatically takes screenshots** of every step.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
-   **CrewAI**: For orchestrating the agent team.
-   **Selenium**: For robust browser automation.
-   **Pytest**: For test execution and reporting.
-   **LangChain**: For LLM integration (Gemini/OpenAI).

## 💡 Key Features
-   **Self-Healing**: If selectors change, the agents can re-analyze the DOM and fix the code.
-   **Visual Reporting**: Generates timestamped HTML reports with embedded screenshots.
-   **Zero-Touch**: From URL to Report with a single command.
